# Project Overview

This is a very basic Physics Engine implementation using Raylib. (Note: This project was made for research purposes and is not meant to be used for commercial projects, the performance is not very optimized)
This project provides five example scenes to demonstrate the capabilities of the engine. You can navigate between the scenes by pressing the number keys (1-5) on your keyboard.

## Scenes

### 1. Collision Handling and Resolution
The first scene demonstrates how the engine handles collisions between objects. Press right click / left click to spawn objects

### 2. Projectile Motion
The second scene is a basic projectile motion example. Press left click to spawn projectiles.

### 3. Tilemap Generation
The third scene shows how the engine can generate and render tilemaps. It's just a simple example to help understand how tilemaps work in the engine.

### 4. Player Movement
In the fourth scene, player movement is demonstrated.

### 5. Platformer Example
The fifth scene is a simple platformer game built within the engine, combining elements from the previous scenes, giving a full overview of how to build a game from scratch using the engine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    - In the repository, click on "Code" and then "Open in Visual Studio".

2. Build and run the project:
    - Once in Visual Studio Press **F5** or navigate to **Debug > Start Debugging** to run the project.
  
### Usage
Once you have opened the project, you can replace the example scenes with your own scenes.
